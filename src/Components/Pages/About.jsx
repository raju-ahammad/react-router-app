            The Bootstrap team has all my praises for this new release, theyâ€™ve done a great job mostly at removing the dependency on JQuery, giving us the utilities API and launching an all new icons library. Remember, however, that this release is still in beta and will be subject to more updates and changes. Want to play around with it? Feel free to fork this repo or send a PR, looking forward to what you build.
